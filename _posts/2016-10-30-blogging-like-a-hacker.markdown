I have desired to blog for many years.  I have even attempted it many times, but without much success.  My failure to blog results from many excuses to include lack of blog platform that I like.  This platform, Jekyll, is nice for the fact that I can use Vim but I am not thrilled with the static site generator component.  I guess Jekyll is better than the alternatives, so here I go in my attempt to do this again.
